            </h5>

            <h2 style="margin: 0 0 0.5em 0; color: black;">Objective:</h2>
            <p> Create a program that consists of multiple mini games to help memory care patients with their
                conditions. This project was originally being developed by one developer but I was brought on to assist
                him when, he was assigned other projects. I was tasked with completing three of six of these games and
                integrate them into the existing project.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin: 0 0 0.5em 0; color: black;">Version Control:</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 12pt;"> Using github, I created a separate branch for each mini games, each branch
                being
                created after a game was done. I took this approach because I recognized that merge conflicts could be a
                problem and that they would be hard to deal with. This way if any merge conflicts did occur the relevant
                prefabs could be extracted from each branch and manually integrated into the master branch. In the end,
                each game was decoupled from the rest of the program so their were minimal issues combining al the
                branches together.
            </p>

                <p style="font-size: 12pt;"> Keeping the target user in mind, the application was designed to be
                    visually uncomplicated and intuitive. As a result, the UI/UX incorporated high contrast design
                    elements with clear and immediate feedback to inputs. For example, some of the games
                    incorporated a drag and drop functionality. In order to make the game more accessible a tap
                    control system was also incorporated. In both of these cases, animations and visual queues were
                    used give immediate feedback.

                    <p style="font-size: 12pt;"> I gained valuable experience learning project's structure that was
                        created by someone else, and smoothly incorporate my working into this existing structure. My
                        goal was to make my code emulate the existing structure to a high degree so that when the
                        project was handed off back to the original developer he would understand my code, and be able
                        to change it easily.

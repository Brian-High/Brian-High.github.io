            <h2 style="margin: 0 0 0.5em 0; color: black;">Objective:</h2>
            <p> Work with two classmates to create a distributed auction house that uses Java Sockets to network at
                least 3 computers together. The assignment was broken down in to a bank, auction house, and agent
                Programs. I took on the agent program which had a GUI and connected with both the auction houses and the
                bank.

                    <p style="font-size: 12pt;"> Since
                        this project had three people working on three separate programs we all worked independently. In
                        order to get our programs to communicate I made a
                        google doc so that everyone could list all the messages that our programs would send and expect
                        to receive. This
                        strategy worked well because everyone was able to work independently and at their own pace for
                        the majority of the time. After the programs were finished in isolation, we all got together
                        and worked out the details of getting our programs to talk to each other through the network.

                <p style="font-size: 12pt;"> This was my first time doing networking, so this taught me a lot about how
                    computers are able to communicate through a network. Another valuable lesson was delineating the
                    program into a front-end UI and a back-end server. This was valuable because it encapsulated all of
                    the sending and waiting for messages to one side of the program while the front-end would just wait
                    for or contact the server when needed.

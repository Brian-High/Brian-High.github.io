            <h2 style="margin: 0 0 0.5em 0; color: black;">Objective:</h2>
            <p> When a client complained about an ongoing issue with a version of this program that was already
                deployed,
                I was tasked with reprogramming it. There were already attempts to fix this program so it was decided it
                would
                be easier to reprogram. Since this program was unsatisfactory for the client, every attempt was made to
                remedy the situation
                and I was able to ship the reprogrammed version in 4 days.
            </p>
            <h2 style="margin: 0 0 0.5em 0; color: black;">The Problem:</h2>
            <div class="row">
                <article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item ">
                    <p style="font-size: 12pt;"> Since this application is UI heavy, the control flow of the program was
                        mainly dictated
                        by the UI animations. The previous programmer elected to use the built-in Unity animator as
                        state-machine to control
                        the program. The issue with this approach was that these animations could not be canceled and
                        when certain sequences
                        occurred the program would enter an irrecoverable state. Also the program has a landscape with
                        numerous animations that
                        were done through 4k videos that were too big and slowed the application down.

                    <h2 style="margin: 0 0 0.5em 0; color: black;">The Solution:</h2>

                    <p style="font-size: 12pt;">My solution was to use the <a href="http://dotween.demigiant.com/"
                            target="_blank">DOTween</a> unity plugin which is more
                        suited to the of controlling the execution of the program. Also I converted all the 4k videos to
                        hd to increase the performance of the application.
                        In the end, the new version of the application was identical to the original with some small
                        improvements and functioned perfectly.

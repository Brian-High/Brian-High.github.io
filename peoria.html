            <h2 style="margin: 0 0 0.5em 0; color: black;">Objective:</h2>
            <p> When a client complained about an ongoing issue with a version of this program that was already deployed,
                I was tasked with reprogramming it. There were already attempts to fix this program so it was decided it would 
                be easier to reprogram. Since this program was unsatisfactory for the client, every attempt was made to remedy the situation 
                and I was able to ship the reprogrammed version in 4 days.
            </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 12pt;"> Since this application is UI heavy, the control flow of the program was mainly dictated 
                        by the UI animations. The previous programmer elected to use the built-in Unity animator as state-machine to control
                        the program. The issue with this approach was that these animations could not be canceled and when certain sequences 
                        occurred the program would enter an irrecoverable state. Also the program has a landscape with numerous animations that
                        were done through videos

                    <p style="font-size: 12pt;">My solution was to use the <a href="http://dotween.demigiant.com/" target = "_blank">DOTween</a> unity plugin which is more
                        suited to the task.

                    <p style="font-size: 12pt;">I learned a lot about planning ahead and leveraging data structures to
                        optimize an algorithm.
                        I was able to improve upon a first attempt, brute force style algorithm by embracing a
                        "fail-fast" approach. The goal was
                        to check the word as it was being placed onto the board to see if it was valid before checking
                        all of the other parts of the
                        board. Also the only part of the board that needed to be checked was the area around where the
                        new word was placed. Another
                        area that was improved upon greatly was using the TRIE to determine what letter a wild card
                        could be rather than check all 26
                        possible letters.
